# Handoff / Resume Notes

Quick-start context for picking this repo back up in a new chat. Open `~/dev/gamma-research`
and read this file first.

Last updated: 2026-07-01 (M1 canonical contract drafted + tested).

## What this repo is

Research-only effort to reverse-engineer and document a **GammaEdge-style** options
gamma-exposure trading framework using public / API-accessible data. **No live trader** (Phase 1
is offline backtesting research only). GammaEdge is an unaffiliated third-party product; its terms
are reconstructed from public sources and tagged known / inferred / unknown-proprietary.

## Key decisions already made

- **Location:** deliberately a standalone repo (`~/dev/gamma-research`), kept separate from the
  Finxact client work.
- **No invented formulas.** Only publicly documented formulas are stated as fact; anything
  unconfirmed is labeled proprietary and paired with an owned `_proxy` approximation.
- **Dealer positioning is unobservable** from public chains, so every GEX/DEX metric is a modeled
  proxy under a stated dealer-sign convention. This is the foundational caveat throughout.

## Current state (all three deliverables done + validated twice)

- `docs/reddit_gamma_strategy_terms.md` - term glossary, each tagged known / inferred /
  unknown-proprietary, with transparent approximations where the real formula is not public.
- `docs/data_provider_assessment.md` - 9-capability matrix + notes for Alpha Vantage, Polygon,
  ORATS, Databento, CBOE, EODHD, plus cross-cutting caveats.
- `docs/phase_1_plan.md` - non-live backtesting engine design (architecture, data model, metric
  engine, backtester, guardrails, milestones M0-M6).
- `prompts/validation_prompt.md` - template for cross-model validation.
- `scripts/build_validation_prompt.py` - generates `prompts/validation_prompt.FILLED.md`
  (git-ignored) with the three docs embedded inline, ready to paste into another model.
- `README.md`, `.gitignore`.

### Code: M1 canonical contract locked (schema + adapter interface, before any vendor code)
- `src/ingest/schema.py` - **single source of truth** for the canonical option-chain schema
  (`CANONICAL_FIELDS`, version `1.0.0`). Pure stdlib: pandas/pyarrow types are *derived* lazily, so
  it imports and validates with no data stack. Enforces point-in-time integrity centrally
  (tz-aware `quote_ts`, `expiration >= quote date`, `oi_asof_date <= quote date`, positive
  strike/spot). Added `oi_asof_date`, `_iv_source`, `_adapter` vs the original doc table; the plan's
  data-model table (section 5) was updated to match.
- `src/ingest/adapter.py` - `ChainAdapter` ABC (`fetch_raw` + `normalize` -> validated `load`
  template method) + a name-keyed registry so config selects EODHD/ORATS/Polygon. No adapter can
  leak a non-conforming frame to the metric engine.
- `src/ingest/io.py` - partitioned parquet store (`symbol=<SYM>/date=<YYYY-MM-DD>/chain.parquet`),
  validates on write and read. First *exercised* in M1 once the stack is installed.
- `tests/test_schema_contract.py` - 20 stdlib-`unittest` tests, all passing now
  (`python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -v`): schema shape, every value/lookahead rule, adapter
  registry, abstract-instantiation guard.
- `requirements.txt` - compatible-release pins (pandas/pyarrow/numpy/scipy); M0 freezes exact.

### Two validation passes already incorporated
1. Round 1 (claims-only; reviewer couldn't see the docs) - fixed GEX formula framing (share vs
   dollar-per-1%-move), Polygon history (~2014 trades/aggs), ORATS 1-min (Aug 2020), Alpha Vantage
   real-time nuance, added cross-cutting caveats. Also fixed the validation prompt so future passes
   can see the docs.
2. Round 2 (true doc review) - **verified** and applied Databento schema-specific history (Apr 2013
   aggregates / Mar 2023 fine schemas), reframed CBOE "2004" as product-specific, relabeled COTMP/
   COTMC as "thinly corroborated" with specific citations, split COI/POI tag (known acronym /
   inferred level), added a corporate-actions backtest risk. CBOE's specific "Jan 2010/2012" dates
   were NOT verifiable, so they were hedged rather than asserted.

## Open threads / next steps

- **`src/` contract not yet committed** (see git log). Nothing else is pending save-wise.
- **Run validation again** with the filled prompt: `python3 scripts/build_validation_prompt.py`,
  then paste `prompts/validation_prompt.FILLED.md` into a fresh model.
- **Finish M0:** create a venv and `pip install -r requirements.txt`, freeze exact versions into a
  lockfile, add the pricer/backtest config module (`src/config/`: rates, dividends, IV-solve, costs)
  and CI that runs `python3 -m unittest`. The canonical contract (schema + adapter interface) is
  already drafted and green, so M0's remaining work is env + config + CI, not data modeling.
- **Then M1:** write the first concrete `ChainAdapter` (EODHD for cheap EOD greeks/IV/OI) against the
  locked schema; its `normalize` must attach `underlying_price`, map type casing to `call`/`put`,
  set `oi_asof_date`, and stamp provenance. NB EODHD options history only reaches ~Q4 2023, so first
  backtests are shallow until a deeper-history vendor is graduated in (M6). Then M2 = Net GEX /
  ZeroGEX with golden tests.
- **Vendor matrix asterisk:** re-check current plan entitlements before buying any provider; history
  depth and features shift by plan.

## Suggested first vendor stack

Prototype on EODHD or Alpha Vantage (cheap EOD greeks/IV/OI), then graduate gamma computations to
ORATS or Polygon for greek quality and history depth, behind a swappable adapter.
